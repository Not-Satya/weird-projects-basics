# weird-projects-basics
These are just weird projects that I make for strengthening my grasp on individual concepts.
Don't judge based on these...
A lot of these could be incomplete, wrong, filled with bugs... idk
This is just to keep a record of what i am learning and maybe increase reusability for future references.
